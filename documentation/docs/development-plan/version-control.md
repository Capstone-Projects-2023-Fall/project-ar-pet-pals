# Version Control
- Version control will be utilized through Github.
- Each feature will be built on its own branch and merged into the Staging branch for testing before being merged into the main branch. 
- The Staging branch will be protected, and two members will need to approve the pull request.
- The main branch will also be protected, and final changes for each sprint will require approval from all team members.
- This project will use GitHub to release demo versions. The release will contain two versions of the app for iOS and Android.
