# Conceptual Design

Unity 3D will serve as the development platform. C# will be used for scripting within the Unity 3D engine. 
The application will be developed for Android and iOS operating systems. Object recognition AI and speech to text 
AI will be integrated to allow virtual pets to interact with real-world objects and a userâ€™s food and activity.

## Background
ARPetPals is a unique mobile AR game concept that combines virtual pet care with fitness, using augmented reality and object recognition. While there are several virtual pet simulation games available, the integration of AR and AI and focus on health sets ARPetPals apart. This app offers players a more immersive and interactive fitness experience. Based on a search on the iOS mobile app store a game called Peridot seems to be a similar product based on its AR spin on a pet game, but does not contain any AI features.
